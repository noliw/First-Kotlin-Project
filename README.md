# ASCII Art

Programming and art are often viewed as opposites, but that couldnâ€™t be farther from the truth. Coding can be a great medium for artistic creativity! One example of this is ASCII art.

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Its general purpose is to give every character, from letters to numbers to symbols, its own unique character code so that the character can be recognized in a digital space.

It can also be used to create art!

ASCII art is a drawing technique that uses a combination of different keyboard characters to create both simple and complex images. The ASCII image above is made up of several characters; for example, the petals on the flower were created using (, _, and ).

In this project, we will be using print statements to create our own ASCII art image in Kotlin!

## Getting Started

To get started with creating your own ASCII art image in Kotlin, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have a Kotlin compiler installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Kotlin from the official Kotlin website.

2. Open a new Kotlin project in your preferred IDE.

3. Use print statements and a combination of keyboard characters to create your ASCII art image.

4. Run your program and admire your beautiful ASCII art!



## Conclusion

ASCII art is a fun and creative way to explore the artistic possibilities of programming. With a little bit of creativity and some print statements, you can create your own unique ASCII art images in Kotlin.
